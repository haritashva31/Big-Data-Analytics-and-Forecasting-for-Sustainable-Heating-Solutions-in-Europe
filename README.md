# Introduction
The European energy landscape is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by the imperative to mitigate climate change and transition towards sustainable energy sources. Central to this transition is the adoption of electric heat pumps for space and water heating, offering a promising alternative to traditional heating systems reliant on fossil fuels. As governments and industries across Europe commit to ambitious carbon reduction targets, the role of heat pumps in decarbonising the heating sector has garnered significant attention.

The rise of heat pumps represents a pivotal shift in energy consumption patterns, with their deployment poised to reshape the dynamics of heating systems. Unlike conventional heating technologies, heat pumps utilise renewable energy sources, such as ambient air, ground, or water, to generate heat, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on finite fossil fuel reserves. Moreover, their versatility and efficiency make them well-suited for various applications, including residential, commercial, and industrial settings.

However, integrating heat pumps into existing energy infrastructures poses several challenges, chief among them being the management of temporal variability in power consumption. Unlike conventional heating systems, which provide a constant heat output, heat pumps exhibit fluctuations in energy demand based on factors such as outdoor temperature, building occupancy, and user behaviour. Addressing these fluctuations is critical to ensuring grid stability and optimising energy system performance.

In this context, the present research aims to explore the feasibility and implications of large-scale electric heat pumps in Europe, leveraging advanced data analytics and forecasting techniques. The study focuses on analyzing the "When2Heat" dataset, which comprises comprehensive time series data on heat demand and coefficient of performance (COP) for heat pumps across 28 European countries. By employing big data analytics and forecasting models, the research seeks to extract valuable insights into the potential of electric heat pumps to drive the transition towards a sustainable and resilient energy future.



# Methodology
To investigate the dynamics of heat demand and the efficiency of heat pumps across 28 European countries, we implemented a comprehensive methodology encompassing data collection, preprocessing, modeling, pipeline development, and insights extraction. This multi-step approach enabled us to analyze hourly time series data and derive valuable insights to inform energy system modeling and planning. Let's delve into each stage of our methodology in detail.

## Data Collection
The first step in our research involved collecting comprehensive data on heat demand and coefficient of performance (COP) for heat pumps across 28 European countries. This data was sourced from the "When2Heat" dataset, which provides hourly time series data covering a significant temporal span.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a pivotal step in ensuring the quality and integrity of the dataset for subsequent analysis. This process encompassed several crucial steps:

Missing Value Imputation: The dataset was examined for missing values, particularly in the context of heat demand and COP data. When missing values were encountered, a specific approach was adopted to maintain temporal consistency. We replaced missing values for a particular day with the daily mean of that specific day across multiple years. This method ensured that missing values were filled with representative values based on historical trends, preserving the integrity of the dataset.

Outlier Detection and Treatment: Outliers, anomalies, or erroneous data points were identified through statistical analysis and domain knowledge. These outliers were treated by either removing them from the dataset or correcting them using appropriate techniques. By addressing outliers, we mitigated their potential impact on the analysis and modeling process.

## Feature Engineering
Due to the complexity and size of the dataset, we employed Apache Spark for data preprocessing. The dataset, consisting of over 750 columns, was initially divided by country codes to facilitate processing. One of the challenges encountered during preprocessing was the presence of empty heat demand columns from 2016 to 2023. To address this, we divided the dataset into two parts: one containing data up to 2016, and the other for predicting values from 2016 to 2031. Predicted values were generated using linear regression techniques based on the preprocessed data.

Through meticulous data preprocessing, we ensured that the dataset was well-prepared for subsequent modeling and analysis, laying the foundation for robust and reliable insights into heat demand and COP for heat pumps across the target countries.

## Modeling
Predictive modeling played a pivotal role in forecasting heat demand and COP for heat pumps across the target countries. While exploring various modeling techniques, including advanced approaches like LSTM and Keras, our analysis revealed challenges related to data independence and temporal dynamics. As a result, we opted to leverage linear regression as our primary modeling technique.

Linear Regression: We utilized linear regression models to establish correlations between input features (e.g., weather variables, demographic indicators) and target variables (heat demand, COP). This approach served as a foundational method for predictive modeling, providing valuable insights into the linear relationships within the dataset and offering a reference point for comparison with more complex algorithms.
Machine Learning Algorithms: In addition to linear regression, we experimented with a range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. While these algorithms have demonstrated success in capturing nonlinear relationships and interactions within the data, we found that their performance was limited by the intrinsic temporal characteristics of the dataset.

Ultimately, after rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we determined that linear regression offered the most pragmatic solution for our predictive modeling task. Its simplicity, interpretability, and ability to capture linear trends effectively made it well-suited for our specific dataset and forecasting objectives. By focusing on linear regression, we aimed to strike a balance between model complexity and predictive accuracy, thereby facilitating actionable insights into heat pump performance across diverse geographical regions.

## Data Transfer and Storage
After completing the preprocessing and modeling stages, the next step involved transferring the data to Google Cloud Storage buckets for storage and further processing. This transfer ensured that the data was securely stored and easily accessible for subsequent analyses. Once in Google Cloud Storage, the data was ingested into BigQuery datasets, where it was organized into country-wise tables along with their corresponding schemas. This structured approach facilitated efficient data management and retrieval, enabling seamless integration with analytical tools and platforms.

## Pipeline Development
To enhance efficiency and scalability, we developed a robust pipeline to automate the transfer of data from Google Cloud Storage to BigQuery datasets. This pipeline streamlined the data ingestion process, minimizing manual intervention and reducing the risk of errors. By implementing automation, we ensured that the latest preprocessed and predicted data were consistently updated in the BigQuery datasets, enabling real-time access to the most relevant information for analysis and decision-making.

## Insights Extraction
With the data successfully ingested into BigQuery, we leveraged the platform's powerful querying capabilities to extract actionable insights. Using specialized queries, we combined the country-wise tables into a unified dataframe containing over 750 columns, encompassing a comprehensive dataset of heat demand and heat pump efficiency metrics. These queries enabled us to analyze trends, patterns, and correlations within the data, shedding light on factors influencing heat demand and the performance of heat pumps across different geographical regions.

Furthermore, through iterative querying and data exploration, we uncovered valuable insights that informed decision-making processes and strategic planning initiatives. By extracting insights related to heat demand patterns, heat pump efficiency, and energy consumption trends, we empowered stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding energy system optimization and sustainability initiatives.

The methodology outlined above represents a holistic approach to conducting research on heat demand and heat pump efficiency in European countries. By meticulously managing the data lifecycle, developing automated pipelines, and leveraging advanced analytics tools, we were able to extract actionable insights and contribute to advancements in energy system modeling and planning.
